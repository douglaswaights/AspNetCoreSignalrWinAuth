# AspNetCoreSignalrWinAuth

Simple sample based on the angular spa template to show signalr on top of full framework with windows authentication

Not currently working!

Changing the launch settings to disable windows auth and allow anonymous auth and then signalr starts working again.... how to make work for windows authentication in an enterprise style setting?
